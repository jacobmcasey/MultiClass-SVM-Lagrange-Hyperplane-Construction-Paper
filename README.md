# MultiClass SVM Lagrange Hyperplane Construction Paper
A Practical Approach to Multi-Class Classification with One-Against-All Support Vector Machines (OAA SVMs)

## Introduction
This repository contains the complete paper (PDF) and codebase (MATLAB) related to the construction of Multi-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) using One-Against-All (OAA) strategies with Lagrange Multipliers. The paper offers a detailed look into the mathematics, voting strategy, and construction of hyperplanes, focusing on linearly separable data with three distinct classes.

## Abstract 
The classification of multiple, linearly separable classes through Support Vector Machines (SVMs) poses a unique challenge that is addressed through the One-Against-All (OAA) approach. This paper covers design the construction of a OAA SVM multi-class classifier, on linearly seperable data with 3 distinct classes. It demystifies the mathematics and voting strategy behind a multi-class SVM that picks the hyperplane decision boundary that gives the highest confidence score for accurate classification. The paper then elucidiates how to construct a hyperplane using lagrange multipliers, showing the underpinnings of SVM classifiers. Fianlly, the paper illustrates the process of classifying three new test samples, providing an insight into OAA SVM multi-class classifiers. The work and methodologies shared in this paper serve as a valuable introductory resource for understanding how they work and how SVM are designed within the field of pattern recognition.
