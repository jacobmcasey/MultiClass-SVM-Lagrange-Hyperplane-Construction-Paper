# MultiClass SVM Lagrange Hyperplane Construction Paper
Paper on Solving Multi-Class Support Vector Machines with Lagrange Multipliers.

## Introduction
This repository contains the complete paper (PDF) and codebase (MATLAB) related to the construction of Multi-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) using One-Against-All (OAA) strategies with Lagrange Multipliers. The paper offers a detailed look into the mathematics, voting strategy, and construction of hyperplanes, focusing on linearly separable data with three distinct classes.

## Abstract 
Ever wondered how you create a margin for Support Vector Machines work with multiple classes, which cannot be seperated by a single linear discriminant? This paper covers designing an One-Against-All (OAA) Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-class classifier, on linearly seperable data with 3 distinct classes. It shows the mathematics and voting strategy behind a multi-class SVM that picks the hyperplane decision boundary that gives the highest confidence score for accurate classification. I then elucidiate how to construct a hyperplane (by hand, no abstraction here!) using lagrange multipliers, showing the underpinnings of SVM classifiers. Finally, I go into showing how three new test samples are classified. This paper offers a thorough exploration of OAA SVM multi-class classifiers, serving as a valuable resource for understanding how they work and are designed.
